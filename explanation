* JavaScript is dynamic language because it can change the type of variable.

* in JavaScript we don't have types of numbers like int, float and ... we have only 'number' type.

______________________________________________________

* 2.Variables:
we can use variable to store data  temporary.
variable are symbolic name of values.
values of a variable can change.
we will write a variable with 'let' or 'var'.

name of variable:
1.cannot be a reserved keyword.
2.it should be meaningful.
3.cannot start with a number.
4.cannot contain space or hyphen (-).
5.they are case-sensitive.
6.A variable name must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).

________________________________________________________

3. constant:
if we don't want to change the value const will be our default choice.

5. math operators:
expression in js is something that produces a value.
comparison operator is a boolean it's true or false.

* 6. Data type:
There are 6 basic data type in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories:
1.Primitive(primary)     2.composite(reference)      3.special data type

1.primitive(primary): string, number and boolean.
2.composite(reference): Object, array and function.
3.special data type: undefined and null.
default type of variables are undefined.

string data type: The string data type is used to represent a textual data and there are created using single or double quotes.
                  string is a sequence of characters.

number data type: The number data type is used to represent positive and negative numbers with or without decimal place and includes some special values which is infinity, -infinity and NaN(not a number).

boolean data type: The boolean data type can hold only 2 values, true and false;

undefined data type: The undefined data type can only have the special value of undefined that means variable has not been assigned a value.

null data type: A null means that there is no value.

______________________________________________________

composite(reference):
composite data type can hold collection of values and more complex entities.

* 7. Object:
An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair, a property key is always a string but the type can be anything.

There are 2 ways 2 work with object properties:
I. Dot notation.
II. Bracket notation.

________________________________________________________

* 8.array:
array is a reference type data and it's a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.
each value in array has a numeric position known as its index and it may contain any data type nd the array index start from 0.
length and type of array is dynamic.
an array is a data structure that we use to represent a list of items.

______________________________________________________

* 9.Array Methods:

1. toString(): "toString()" methods converts an array to a string of array values.

2. join(): "join()" method are able to convert an array into a string, but in addition we can specify the separator. 

3. pop(): "pop()" method removes the last element of an array.

4. push(): "push()" method add new element at the end of an array.

5. shift(): "shift()" method is equivalent to pop() method but it's working on first element instead of the last.

6. unshift(): "unshift()" method add new elements at the beginning of an array.

7. changing element: we can change one of the elements of an array by using index number.

8. length property: it returns the length of an array.

9. splice(): "splice()" method can be used to add new elements to an array.
             the first parameter defines the position of the new element. (index[i])
             the second parameter defines how many parameters should be removed, we can remove elements without leaving hole in an array.
             this method returns an array with deleted items.

10. concat(): "concat()" method creates a new array by merging existing array and it can take strings as an arguments.

11.slice(): "slice()" method slices out a piece of an array into a new array.
            the first parameter is the start position or index. index[i]
            the second parameter is the finish position or index and it is not included.

12. sort(): "sort()" method can sort an array alphabetically.

13. reverse(): "reverse()" method sort an array in descending order.

14. indexOf(): "indexOf()" method searches an array for an element value and returns it position.
    lastindexOf(): it is the same as indexOf(), but it returns the position of the last occurrence of the specified element.

15. include(): "include()" method determines whether an array contains a specified element 

________________________________________________________

* 10. Functions:

function is a set of statement that performs a task or calculate a value.

function executes a block of code and since functions are objects it is possible to assign them to variable.

basically it is a piece of code that do one or more actions

parameter of a function is only meaningful in that function.

if we don't give a value to our argument by default is undefined.
