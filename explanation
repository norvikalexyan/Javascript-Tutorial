* JavaScript is dynamic language because it can change the type of variable.

* in JavaScript we don't have types of numbers like int, float and ... we have only 'number' type.

______________________________________________________

* 2.Variables:
we can use variable to store data  temporary.
variable are symbolic name of values.
values of a variable can change.
we will write a variable with 'let' or 'var'.

name of variable:
1.cannot be a reserved keyword.
2.it should be meaningful.
3.cannot start with a number.
4.cannot contain space or hyphen (-).
5.they are case-sensitive.
6.A variable name must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).

* 6. Data type:
There are 6 basic data type in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories:
1.Primitive(primary)     2.composite(reference)      3.special data type

1.primitive(primary): string, number and boolean.
2.composite(reference): Object, array and function.
3.special data type: undefined and null.
default type of variables are undefined.

string data type: The string data type is used to represent a textual data and there are created using single or double quotes.

number data type: The number data type is used to represent positive and negative numbers with or without decimal place and includes some special values which is infinity, -infinity and NaN(not a number).

boolean data type: The boolean data type can hold only 2 values, true and false;

undefined data type: The undefined data type can only have the special value of undefined that means variable has not been assigned a value.

null data type: A null means that there is no value.

______________________________________________________

composite(reference):
composite data type can hold collection of values and more complex entities.

* 7. Object:
An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair, a property key is always a string but the type can be anything.

There are 2 ways 2 work with object properties:
I. Dot notation.
II. Bracket notation.

________________________________________________________

* 8.array:
array is a reference type data and it's a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.
each value in array has a numeric position known as its index and it may contain any data type nd the array index start from 0.
length and type of array is dynamic.

* 9.Array Methods:

1. toString(): "toString()" methods converts an array to a string of array values.

2. join(): "join()" method are able to convert an array into a string, but in addition we can specify the separator. 

3. pop(): "pop()" method removes the last element of an array.

4. push(): "push()" method add new element at the end of an array.
