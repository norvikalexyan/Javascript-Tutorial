* what is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allow us to execute complex features on web pages and we are enable to create dynamically updating content,
every time a page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at, display timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D and etc.

JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. the interpreted language is the language that the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned, we don't have to transform the code into different form before the browser runs it and the code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that,
The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that,
JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called 'just-in-time-compiling' to improve performance,
JavaScript source code gets collect into faster, binary format while the script is being used so that it can run as quickly as possible.

* what can JavaScript really do?
the core client side JavaScript language consist of some common programming features that allow us to do things like:
1.Store useful values inside variables.
2.Operations on piece of text (known as 'string' in programming).
3.Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.

* The functionality built on top of the client-side in JavaScript language is called 'Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)' provides us with extra superpowers to use in JavaScript code.
APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to execute programs that would be hard or impossible to execute.
APIs has 2 categories:

1. Browser APIs:
Browser APIs are built into our web browser and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment or do other useful complex things like:
I. The DOM (Document Object Model) API allow us to retouch HTML and CSS, creating and removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to our page,
    every time we see a popup window appear on a page or some new content displayed, that's the DOM action.
II. The Geolocation API recover geographical information, this is how google maps is able to find our location on a map.
III. The 'Canvas' and 'WebGL' APIs allow us to create animated 2D/3D graphics.
IV. Audio and Video APIs will allow us to do really interesting things with multimedia.

2. Third party APIs:
Third party APIs are not built into browser by default and you have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web.

* JavaScript is dynamic language because it can change the type of variable.

* in JavaScript we don't have types of numbers like int, float and ... we have only 'number' type.

______________________________________________________

* 1. console.log():
the console method log() outputs a message to the web console, 
the message may be a single string or any one or more JavaScript objects.
______________________________________________________

* 2.Variables:
A variable is a named location for storing a value and that value can be accessed through a predetermined name.
we can use variable to store data temporary.
variable are symbolic name of values.
values of a variable can change.
we will write a variable with 'let' or 'var'.

name of variable:
1.cannot be a reserved keyword.
2.it should be meaningful.
3.cannot start with a number.
4.cannot contain space or hyphen (-).
5.they are case-sensitive.
6.A variable name must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).

________________________________________________________

3. constant:
The value of a constant cannot be changed through reassignment and it cannot be redeclare.
if we don't want to change the value const will be our default choice.
________________________________________________________

5. math operators:
expression in js is something that produces a value.
comparison operator is a boolean it's true or false.

________________________________________________________

* 6. Data type:
There are 6 basic data type in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories:
1.Primitive(primary)     2.composite(reference)      3.special data type

1.primitive(primary): string, number and boolean.
2.composite(reference): Object, array and function.
3.special data type: undefined and null.
default type of variables are undefined.

string data type: The string data type is used to represent a textual data and there are created using single or double quotes.
                  string is a sequence of characters.

number data type: The number data type is used to represent positive and negative numbers with or without decimal place and includes some special values which is infinity, -infinity and NaN(not a number).

boolean data type: The boolean data type can hold only 2 values, true and false;

undefined data type: The undefined data type can only have the special value of undefined that means variable has not been assigned a value.

null data type: A null means that there is no value.

______________________________________________________

composite(reference):
composite data type can hold collection of values and more complex entities.

* 7. Object:
An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair, a property key is always a string but the type can be anything.

There are 2 ways 2 work with object properties:
I. Dot notation.
II. Bracket notation.

________________________________________________________

* 8.array:
array is a reference type data and it's a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.
each value in array has a numeric position known as its index and it may contain any data type nd the array index start from 0.
length and type of array is dynamic.
an array is a data structure that we use to represent a list of items.

______________________________________________________

* 9.Array Methods:

1. toString(): "toString()" methods converts an array to a string of array values.

2. join(): "join()" method are able to convert an array into a string, but in addition we can specify the separator. 

3. pop(): "pop()" method removes the last element of an array.

4. push(): "push()" method add new element at the end of an array.

5. shift(): "shift()" method is equivalent to pop() method but it's working on first element instead of the last.

6. unshift(): "unshift()" method add new elements at the beginning of an array.

7. changing element: we can change one of the elements of an array by using index number.

8. length property: it returns the length of an array.

9. splice(): "splice()" method can be used to add new elements to an array.
             the first parameter defines the position of the new element. (index[i])
             the second parameter defines how many parameters should be removed, we can remove elements without leaving hole in an array.
             this method returns an array with deleted items.

10. concat(): "concat()" method creates a new array by merging existing array and it can take strings as an arguments.

11.slice(): "slice()" method slices out a piece of an array into a new array.
            the first parameter is the start position or index. index[i]
            the second parameter is the finish position or index and it is not included.

12. sort(): "sort()" method can sort an array alphabetically.

13. reverse(): "reverse()" method sort an array in descending order.

14. indexOf(): "indexOf()" method searches an array for an element value and returns it position.
    lastindexOf(): it is the same as indexOf(), but it returns the position of the last occurrence of the specified element.

15. include(): "include()" method determines whether an array contains a specified element

* 10. Functions:

function is a set of statement that performs a task or calculate a value.

function executes a block of code and since functions are objects it is possible to assign them to variable.

basically it is a piece of code that do one or more actions

parameter of a function is only meaningful in that function.

if we don't give a value to our argument by default is undefined.
